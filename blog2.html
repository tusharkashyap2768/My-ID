            <h2>
                First of all, What the heck is Vanilla Js. Well,
            </h2> 
            <h3>
                VanillaJS is a term for library/framework free javascript.
                
                Its sometimes ironically referred to as a library, as a joke for people who could be seen as mindlessly using different frameworks, especially jQuery.
                
                Some people have gone so far to release this library, usually with an empty or comment-only js file

                Yes, Learning React is possible without knowing JavaScript in depth, and I am also guilty of the same crime but I cannot stress more on this that It's always better to know JavaScript 
                before learning any framework for the obvious reason, " You understand better."
             
            </p>
            <p>
                As React is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20declarative%20programming,without%20describing%20its%20control%20flow.">declarative framework</a>
                 You dont need to know whats actually happening in background, but if you need to become a better developer you should know how things work. This will not only develop your core skills but also make you understand the framework better.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Trust me, this will even help you a lot while debugging, if you know how things work.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you dont need to master JavaScript, well u really can't ðŸ˜› 
                If you fall into this trap of mastering one prerequisite and then moving to another, you will be stuck forever, and will never really learn new things.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what is the conclusion, you should or should'nt learn Vanilla Js before React or for say any framework?
                Well, My suggestion is to learn the basics atleast, see that u can code in that language, try to create one or few basic
                web apps and then you're good to go!
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe most of JavaScript can be learned along the way when learning React, because then you experience it in context while building web applications. That's exciting and that's what drives us as human beings. So keep yourself excited while learning and don't hang around too long with the fundamentals where you cannot see the purpose without ever applying them in a real world scenario. Start to build real projects. Stay curious! Move forth and back between JavaScript and React while you learn React.
