            <p class="blog">All of my life I have been a rebel, not accepting things that were taught to me or said to me that didn't make the logic or convinced me.</p>
            <p class="blog"> Due to this nature, I was always isolated from society which has a tendency to follow the orthodox path or to be on a safer and secure path which according to me is not wrong but is a boring and non-creative approach towards life and made no purpose or logic to me.</p>
            <p class="blog"> This behavior to take risks and carefree attitude towards life was not convincing to my peers or anyone around me which created a careless image of mine in their minds. I never minded or cared for them to be convinced by my thoughts, but yet when your thought is outnumbered in society or peers, </p>
            <p class="blog"> you start to question yourself that <strong>ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT? WHAT IF YOU FAIL?</strong>. You are not going to be consoled but rathered taunted by them who disagreed with you.</p>
